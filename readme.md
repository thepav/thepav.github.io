Personal Website
====

The cool thing about this website is that I use a CMS that I defined, tied to firebase. You'll notice that there's no actual content here in the html. It's all dynamically generated via configuration I've defined in firebase. Which means the content can be updated on the fly and you'll see the change right on the site as you're looking at it.
